## Summary

This is an exercise in React. This simple React project serves as notes, practice in the fundamentals of React, and learning the intermediate concepts of React. This covers concepts of functional vs class components to hooks and Context. The app is from online tutorials (most from Frontened Masters) and serves as a reference for the concepts and style of how to build React apps instead of going through several (hundred) notes or different websites.

The initial commits will just be simple script tags with React.createElement in a HTML file and CDN links. The successive commits use more of the tools and libraries. Some of the features will be on different branches since the verbiage. For example, the code for Context will conflict with Redux. Or if using tools (like Saga) to manage asynchronous code or other features it will get complex and need a different branch to avoid confusion.

Follow on commits include React hooks (easy way to access state), Error Boundaries (if bad data comes in from an API, React will catch it and prevent the app from crashing), Modals (dialog box), Context (app state management), and testing with Jest.
